      <p>We are sharing a global crisis caused by the COVID pandemic which has created the conditions for systemic change. However there are many other crises playing out at the same time, making the potential for change far more significant.</p>

      <p>So what should change? <br>How should that change happen?<br>And what are we changing to?</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>This is an experiment in participatory democracy. It aims to extend our democratic rights beyond electoral voting to allow more voices to be heard.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="">
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>By sharing the insights from your conversations we can then share real insights to policymakers and decision makers. We will collate all the collected data into a report that will be widely distributed in both local and state government and through the Climate Change Council.</p>
